# hey read drawyesnononononoyes or whatever right


# so then how do we move and fire?

# what?

# so we take chartacter inputs still but the controller needs to send out right so we have to program a wirter that is the controller

# lets say we are playing paintball program
# what can our player do
# they can move aim and shoot just that its a simple one right
# okay so we ca do the int update right

HEY PLAYER HIT RIGHT ARROW, WELL WE MOVE THEM X TO THE RIGHT
BUT HERE WE ARE JUST USING INTEGER INCREMENTS AND DECREMENTS 
YOU CAN STILL THINK OF THIS AS MOTION
IF YOU VIEW A DOT ON AN INTEGER INCREMENTED NUMBERLINE IS IT | IS IT - IDK

but hey they hit the right arrow

right?


okay so how do we move and jump?

well the controller needs a dictionary and key or a key and value wtf its called
right

so we set our countroller up to do input logic sanitization

okay

if the input catcher finds that an assorted amount of buttons are pressed 
we concatenate predefined definitions and verbs or whatever to indicate what to do 
right 

so now the user input is like some string we define and then look up its sequential actions for the next frame update
whats that mean
well lets say they hold down move right and hit space bar to fire paintball gun
lets assume paintball gun is autoaiming but you cannot shoot through obstacles right

okay so here you might would say

from your controller program thats doing logic combinations of sanitizing input of keyboard using time and the whatever from drawyesno

you could send to the game program like a string or something that says 

move right then fire 


idk right

output = 'rightFire'

compared to what??
okay shit they can aim i forgot

okay so how do they aim

well wasd for player movement 

up down left right for aim

space bar to shoot

idk how many possible combinations there are of doing all
but in the possibilites the differentations cause different physicallites of in the moment decision right?
so the string identifiers should be hooked up tologic that tells the animation and logic engine what order to draw things in given thaqt 
there is a time requirement of only deviate this x amount of time to the frame drawing before you just draw
only wait an x amount of time for user input (even smaller possibly? possibly not at all actually idk) but only wait
only wait an x amount of time for input before you draw too
idk save it and make it later if it works
