so possibly for simplicity lets reduce full columnb and row draw space back to like a 50 by 50 square so we get faster performance on slower stuff and its less jittery?





so we need to add a new file to test some things
lets basically clone the game of life draw board
our ship will be a thing like this
 .
...


enemies will be a thing like this
...
...
...

and our draw board dots will be the game of liffe smaller dots right

so lets make thtat like clone game of life draw mechanisms then write some loops
to gently or slowly try to move the ship from middle of draw board to right
then all the way to left

if we get that working we can try to add preprogrammed animation of enemy coming onto screen and moving down or something

so we need draw board logic

insertion into matricy logic and deletion of previous location logic

and that should go

we can then work on using the modules mentioned by gemini to try to capture single character input as a time frame but idk if that will work 


so basically lets add another todo this may be easier to do first

look at draw yes no yes no yes no

make  a single output stream numberoline with gemini modules mentioned that lets us a to lower number and d to increase number like wasd w left and d right a up and s down then we have duplicate of arrow keys and i know how to check wasd input in python not arrow keys
but hey how do you caputre arrow keys?? we could make an arrow key one that doesnt update and redraw until you move

so every key press is waitng on enter
we can move hit enter and screen draws new frame 

but once that works how do we delete need to press enter


okay cool read these TODOS

implement them and clean up all other scratch files
