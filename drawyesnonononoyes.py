# what we wann do is start printing a number input? no keep printing
# input? yes if the user types 

# so fuck i dont have enough time to copy over the gemini answer to user input without enter but they say
# use the termios and tty librarys to set raw mode? and then take only single character input

# so possibly we use the time library to say hey have they entered a single charaacer? no well shit its been like 0.003m? so fuck we gotta draw the next screen this equals hey dont increment hte number 

# oh they did push a character
# well incrememnt the number with like the right arrow  or something
# decrement with left arrow or something like this should be the ouput right



# we are starting our program here:
